# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Meet the team of young and upcoming scientist who work with ETiX-embryoids in the Department of Biology! In our team we believe in supporting each other, speaking our mind freely, and pushing the boundaries of what can currently be done with embryo-like structures. Do you think you may want to join us??? Then please send an informal inquiry to Gianluca Amadei (gianluca.amadei@unipd.it).
